Hello Fellow Tech Enthusiasts, This is a simple repository to explain how git commands work and make our lives simpler as developers

```git
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```

This command is used to configure vscode as a default text editor for our git commits, It enables us to write more clear and brief git commits which is generally a good practice especially when you work with a team of developers. Just type this command in your CLI and your git commit text editor will be configured to vscode.
